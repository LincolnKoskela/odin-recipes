This project is me taking time out of each day to practice my html skills,
 and turn this project into something to build off of. That's the goal. 
Once I have a basic understanding of how to create cool stuff online, I'll continue to build from there. 
For now, it's just one step ata time. 
I'll use this as a timeline to reflect on experience through the process
